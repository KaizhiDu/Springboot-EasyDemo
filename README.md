# Springboot-EasyDemo
   This is a easy demo for Springboot. 
   I have been developing projects with SSM framework. Recently, my friends recommended that I use springboot for development, so I'm going to teach myself about springboot and do a small CRUD project. Springboot is really faster and more convenient than SSM.

   1. There is no need to link the database. The Dao layer has completed the data business simulation. The project can be run directly.

   2. This small project shows the basic characteristics of springboot - automatic configuration. Moreover, you can change the default configuration through a series of processes, such as view parser and interceptor.

   3. It is impossible to use JSP because of the built-in Servlet in springboot(If you accustomed to use JSP, you can introduce external servlets instead of default configurations). Template engines, I use TheymeLeaf, which is more compatible with HTML. Of course, this is very troublesome for me who are accustomed to using JSP.
